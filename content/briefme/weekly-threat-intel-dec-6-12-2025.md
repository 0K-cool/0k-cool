## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Between December 6 and December 12, 2025, the threat landscape was dominated by rapid, at-scale exploitation of the critical React2Shell vulnerability (CVE-2025-55182), alongside notable ransomware activity from DeadLock and Makop operators leveraging BYOVD and privilege‑escalation chains to bypass defenses. Multiple vendors and CISA confirmed active React2Shell exploitation with a CVSS 10.0 impact on React Server Components and Next.js, driving urgent patching and widespread scanning across hundreds of thousands of internet‑exposed services. Ransomware campaigns during the week showed a continued shift toward vulnerable driver abuse, AV‑killer tooling, and RDP‑centric initial access, raising risk particularly for Windows‑heavy and RDP‑exposed environments. SOC teams should prioritize React2Shell remediation and hunting, tighten RDP exposure, and deploy driver‑abuse detection and new ransomware‑focused YARA and network rules from this briefing.

## CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES (Top 5)

#### 4.1 React2Shell – CVE-2025-55182 (React Server Components / Next.js)

- Details: Critical unauthenticated RCE in React Server Components and downstream frameworks (including Next.js 15.x/16.x with App Router), CVSS 10.0, added to CISA KEV on December 5 with active exploitation observed starting December 3.
- Attack vector: Single malicious HTTP request to vulnerable server function endpoints enables arbitrary code execution with application privileges, often via unsafe deserialization of payloads.
- IOCs / behavior: Mass scanning from hundreds of IPs, suspicious requests hitting RSC/Next.js endpoints, rapid child process execution (shells, curl/wget), persistence via systemd/cron/rc.local and covert Node.js installations, plus outbound connections to multiple cloud‑hosted C2 servers and webhook/canarytoken beacons.
- Detection guidance: See Sigma Rule "CVE-2025-55182 React2Shell Exploitation" in Section 9.1.

Detection Query (Pseudo-code - Generic SIEM Logic):

```pseudo
filter web_logs
where http_method == "POST"
  and url_path contains "/_next/" or "/react/" or "/server-actions"
  and http_status in (500, 502, 503)
  and request_body contains "$ACTION_" or "Flight"
group by src_ip, url_path
having count() > threshold in 5 minutes
```

- Remediation:
    - Patch React/Next.js to vendor‑fixed versions and follow framework‑vendor guidance for affected RSC/Server Actions.
    - Immediately inventory internet‑exposed React/Next apps, apply compensating controls (WAF rules for suspicious RSC endpoints, blocking PoC payload patterns), and perform compromise assessment on all exposed instances per KEV notes.


#### 4.2 Baidu Antivirus Driver – CVE-2024-51324 (DeadLock BYOVD)

- Details: Vulnerability in a Baidu Antivirus signed driver enables attackers to exploit kernel‑mode functionality for EDR/AV termination in a BYOVD pattern, leveraged by recent DeadLock ransomware campaigns disclosed December 9–10.
- Attack vector: Attackers load the vulnerable signed driver after initial foothold, then call driver IOCTLs to kill security processes and disable defenses prior to ransomware execution.
- IOCs / behavior: Presence of the vulnerable driver file on endpoints, newly created or suspicious services responsible for loading the driver, PowerShell‑based UAC bypass scripts, bulk termination of EDR/AV services, and deletion of volume shadow copies.
- Detection guidance: See Sigma Rule "DeadLock BYOVD Driver Abuse" in Section 9.1 and YARA Rule "DeadLock_Ransomware_Family" in Section 9.2.

Detection Query (Pseudo-code - Generic SIEM Logic):

```pseudo
filter edr_driver_events
where driver_file_name in ("baiduav.sys","bdvedr.sys")
  and signed == true
  and initiator_process in ("powershell.exe","cmd.exe")
```

- Remediation:
    - Block and uninstall vulnerable Baidu Antivirus driver versions where present, and implement kernel‑driver allow‑listing in EDR where possible.
    - Monitor and block use of known vulnerable drivers, and apply vendor/OS mitigations for BYOVD techniques (e.g., Windows vulnerable driver blocklists).


#### 4.3 Makop Ransomware Tooling (Multiple Privilege Escalation CVEs)

- Details: Updated Makop (Phobos family) campaigns integrate GuLoader, several Windows local privilege‑escalation exploits, and AV‑killer tools; activity documented December 7–10.
- Attack vector: Initial access via exposed/brute‑forced RDP, followed by execution of GuLoader to pull additional payloads (AgentTesla, FormBook, Makop) and use of privilege‑escalation CVEs plus service abuse to gain SYSTEM and disable defenses.
- IOCs / behavior: RDP logon attempts from unusual geolocations, GuLoader droppers (often packed binaries), creation of services to load malicious drivers or AV‑killer utilities, and Makop ransomware binaries under benign‑looking filenames in user directories.
- Detection guidance: See YARA Rule "Makop_Ransomware_Family" and Snort Rule "Makop_RDP_C2_Activity" in Section 9.
- Remediation:
    - Restrict and harden RDP (VPN‑only access, MFA, lockout policies) and patch Windows privilege‑escalation vulnerabilities highlighted in vendor advisories associated with GuLoader/Makop chains.
    - Remove unauthorized remote‑access tools and AV‑killers, rotate credentials, and validate backup integrity and isolation.


#### 4.4 React2Shell / Next.js Duplicate Advisory (CVE-2025-66478)

- Details: Next.js initially tracked CVE-2025-66478 as a separate RCE issue but later rejected it as a duplicate of CVE‑2025‑55182; the confusion raised patch‑validation questions.
- Attack vector: Same as React2Shell, via vulnerable Next.js server components/Server Actions.
- IOCs / behavior: Overlaps with CVE‑2025‑55182 activity; organizations may have partial patching if they addressed only one ID.
- Detection guidance: Same as CVE‑2025‑55182; see corresponding Sigma rule.
- Remediation:
    - Normalize vulnerability management so both IDs map to the same underlying React2Shell patch and verification steps.
    - Confirm that all Next.js versions listed as affected in vendor advisories are upgraded, not just those referencing the superseded CVE.


#### 4.5 Additional React/Next.js Ecosystem Exposure (KEV Context)

- Details: CISA KEV metadata for CVE‑2025‑55182 stresses automation, active exploitation, and mandates federal remediation by December 12.
- Attack vector: Broad internet‑wide scanning for any React Server Components endpoint; threat actors include China‑nexus and other groups.
- IOCs / behavior: High‑volume scanning IPs, some tied to cloud providers; beaconing to attacker‑controlled infrastructure used for telemetry and simple exfiltration.
- Detection guidance: See Snort/Suricata rule "React2Shell_Exploitation_Traffic" in Section 9.3.
- Remediation:
    - Treat all React/Next.js apps as high‑priority internet attack surface; complete KEV‑aligned patching and post‑patch compromise assessments.
    - Add WAF rules filtering suspicious RSC/Flight payloads and rate‑limit suspicious scanning behavior from abusive IPs.

### 9.4 OSQuery Queries (Endpoint Hunting)

```sql
-- React2Shell persistence via systemd/cron/rc.local
-- Platform: Linux
-- Use case: Hunting
SELECT
    'systemd' AS source,
    name,
    path,
    username
FROM systemd_units
WHERE
    path LIKE '%system_os.service%' OR
    path LIKE '%node%' AND path LIKE '%/lib/systemd/%'

UNION ALL

SELECT
    'cron' AS source,
    command AS name,
    path,
    username
FROM crontab
WHERE
    command LIKE '%system_os%' OR command LIKE '%node%'

UNION ALL

SELECT
    'rc.local' AS source,
    path,
    path AS name,
    '' AS username
FROM file
WHERE
    path LIKE '/etc/rc.local';
```

```sql
-- Makop AV-killer and suspicious service creation
-- Platform: Windows
-- Use case: Hunting
SELECT
    name,
    display_name,
    path,
    start_type,
    user_account
FROM services
WHERE
    (path LIKE '%guloader%' OR path LIKE '%makop%' OR
     path LIKE '%avkiller%')
    AND start_type IN ('AUTO_START','DEMAND_START');
```

**Deployment Guidance (Summary)**

- Convert Sigma rules with sigmac/pySigma for Splunk, Sentinel, Elastic, QRadar, Chronicle, etc.
- Deploy YARA to EDR/file scanners and VirusTotal Hunting for retro‑hunting on DeadLock/Makop payloads.
- Import Snort/Suricata signatures into IDS/IPS or Security Onion; adapt for NGFW custom signatures where applicable.
- Run OSQuery hunts via Fleet, Kolide, Uptycs, or native osquery for targeted sweeps on suspect populations.

## DEFENSIVE RECOMMENDATIONS

**IMMEDIATE (0–24 hours)**

- [ ] **Patch all React/Next.js instances for CVE‑2025‑55182/66478 and validate via vendor detection scripts.**
- [ ] **Block or uninstall vulnerable Baidu Antivirus drivers and enable OS‑level vulnerable‑driver blocklists.**
- [ ] **Restrict external RDP access (VPN‑only, MFA) and implement geo/IP‑based blocking for high‑risk regions.**
- [ ] **Deploy this week's Sigma, YARA, and Snort rules into test→production pipelines with tight monitoring for false positives.**

**SHORT‑TERM (24–72 hours)**

- [ ] Run focused compromise‑assessment hunts on systems exposed to React2Shell prior to patching using provided Sigma/OSQuery queries.
- [ ] Hunt for BYOVD patterns and AV‑killer artifacts on all Windows endpoints, correlating driver loads with security‑service termination.
- [ ] Baseline and tune detections for RDP usage and GuLoader/Makop indicators, especially in Indian and other high‑risk environments.
- [ ] Validate backup coverage, isolation, and restore times for critical systems targeted by ransomware (Windows servers, file shares, SaaS integrations).

**ONGOING (Strategic)**

- [ ] Embed KEV‑driven patch SLAs into vulnerability management, ensuring critical web‑app flaws receive highest priority.
- [ ] Implement driver‑control policies as part of EDR strategy, treating signed drivers as controlled assets with continuous monitoring.
- [ ] Expand detection‑as‑code practices using Sigma/YARA/Snort with automated QA and false‑positive tracking.
- [ ] Strengthen security‑by‑design for web and cloud apps, including secure framework configuration, supply‑chain scanning, and threat‑modelling for RCE surfaces.
